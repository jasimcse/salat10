Salat10 is a prayer time calculator for Muslims and offers a lot of additional features that other apps do not have. It also calculates Hijri dates based on the current Julian calendar date.

The usage of the app is very simple and the app tries to take care of most of the manual work for you. It will automatically determine your location and pick the calculation angles that are most relevant to your area to give you accurate timings. However you still have control over these settings if you want to adjust them yourself.

The app must remain open for the athaan to function properly (if you are using BlackBerry 10 OS 10.2 and below). 30 minutes before an event happens you will notice it display a message on the event itself, and 5 minutes before the event the countdown will get even more verbose. Once the new event comes in you will hear and see the notification if you have enabled the settings.
