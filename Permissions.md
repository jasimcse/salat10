# Explanation #

  * Calendar: This permission is needed only when accessing the "Export to Calendar" and "Clear Exported Events" features. The app needs to access your calendar service in order to register and unregister the events from there.

  * Location: This is required for the app to be able to access location services so that it can find your GPS coordinates and base the calculations on that. This is necessary for both auto-detection as well as detection via the location picker.

  * Run in Background: This permission is required so that the app can play the athaan even while your device is in the idle state. Usually apps in the idle state are put to "sleep" to maximize battery usage and thus they cannot run. With this permission enabled, the operating system allows the app to process instructions when it needs to. Rest assured Salat10 has been optimized and is continually being optimized to be battery efficient and use the least amount of processing time to do its work.
